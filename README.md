The same model is applicable for all the 3 tasks.


## Requirements:-
environment file: mlproject.yml
model: final.h5 (in the saved_model folder)
evaluation_final.ipynb

## Steps:-
1. Check the requirements
2.  Run the evaluation_final.ipynb file, after changing the environments for all the 3 tasks to cartpole.py
3.  You will get the output as : Average Score of that respective tasks, along with the values of 100 runs.


## Note :-
The best scores we get is an average of 500 over the 100 games for all 3 tasks. But we aren't able to reproduce them by just giving the seeds. 
We still expect getting a score between 490 and 500.
